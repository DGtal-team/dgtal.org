The DGtal project (http://dgtal.org) has received the software award at the Symposium on Geometry Processing 2016 (june 20th-24th, Berlin). 

The price acknowledge a high quality open-source  software dedicated to the geometry processing of shapes. Initiated by a collaboration between LIRIS and LAMA lab (Universit√© de Savoie Mont-Blanc), the collaborative DGtal project has become crucial in the internaiton digital geometry community with many contributions from various teams  in this topic.

Taking into account the elegantly structured code, the ease with which users can interface into the code-base, and the varied scope of applications, the SGP Software Award Committee have decided that this software package is the most deserving of the candidates considered.

We would like to thank the community and all developers that help us on this project.
